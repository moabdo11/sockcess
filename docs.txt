SOCKCESS SITE DOCS

This site consists of 3 main components:



1. Landing page

This is where customers and prospective customers land when they first navigate to
the website.

This page contains the value proposition of sockcess, and yields information on who
we are, what common questions exist about our service, how to contact us, and who is
saying good things about us.

This page also contains functionality for signing up for the service, signing into
the service, and submitting a question to us.



2. Post Sign-Up Slideshow and first selection

This is the funnel we push people through after getting them to sign up. It consists
of three slides, each identifying an element of our service (pick a sock, get the sock,
login to your account to manage your shit).

The first selection comes after the slideshow. Users can pick one of three choices:
style1 style2 or RANDOM. After picking a given style, users are then prompted for
their billing information: name, address, card number etc.



3. User HomePage

This is where users go. This site is very simple; users can pick their sock for the
month, or they can manage their account settings, or they can log out. Easy Peasy.
